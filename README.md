# hash_function
custom hash function algorithm created by me implemented in python

this is simple pseudo random number generator based hash generating function/algorithm.
Basic principal behind this algorithm is; a pseudo number generator whose output depends on two input number (ascii character code and position of character). 
though this algorithm didn't gone through rigor testing still useful for educational purposes.
